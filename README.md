## Project Overview
The "SQL Projects" repository includes various SQL tasks and projects. This repository demonstrates the practical application of SQL to address real-world scenarios, including data manipulation, querying, and stored procedure implementation using the Microsoft's Adventure Works Database 2022.


## Installation
To explore or run the SQL queries and stored procedures:
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
   
            https://github.com/jaiswalchitransh/SQL-Projects.git
   
2. Open the SQL scripts in your preferred SQL Environment, such as Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) or Azure Data Studio.

3. Connect to the  Microsoft's Adventure Works Database 2022 with the SQL Environment. You can download the `AdventureWorks2022.bak` OLTP or Online Transaction Processing from [microsoft.com](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/samples/adventureworks-install-configure?view=sql-server-ver16&tabs=ssms/). 

4. Execute the SQL scripts and stored procedures as described in each task.


## Usage
